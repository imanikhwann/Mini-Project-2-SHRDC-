# Mini-Project-2-SHRDC-
Decision Tree

This is a mini project for AI & ML Competence for Industry 4.0 with Selangor Human Resources Department Centre (SHRDC).

Decision Tree model is used on wine dataset from scikit-learn to perform classification. Numpy and Pandas module are used to perform preprocessing on the datasets before train into the model. The accuracy, f1 score  are calculated to evaluate the model's performnce. Overall the model performed badly on predictiing the data.
